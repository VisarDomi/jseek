# Purpose overview of application

This application is intended to track and manage job application in the IT and Software industry. It helps by categorizing and tracking various job application in their various stages, and can also be used as an analysis tool to understand differences in CVs or Portfolios used. 


# Key features

In it's most basic form, the application needs to fulfill the following needs.

- A way to input new leads and opportunities. 
	- This inputting mechanism should be straightforward and easy to use to save as much time as possible. 
	- A link to the job posting or source of lead is interesting to have. This could be helpful in the analysis phase to understand which leads are more successful. 
- A way to visualize all the leads in their various stages. This could be a simple list of elements. Bonus points for an aggregation or grouping mechanism to help when there are more than 20-30 leads active. 
- A way to update the current progress/status of any lead. This should be primarily based on tagging in the earlier versions, with crucial information such as 'gut feeling notes', 'potential compensation discussed' and other tags. Bonus points for user generated tags. 
- A simple analysis page showing different basic statics, mainly by grouping or simple distributions. 
- The user is given a 'next steps' section based on the various progress of the leads and interviews. For example, 
	- "Interview with Microsoft, Friday 11:00AM. Technical interview with team lead."
	- "Soft Skills interview with Amazon, Thusrday 22/06, 10:00PM"
	- "Take home assignment deadline for Deliveroo, this Friday midnight."
- Some of these next steps may be colored/classified differently if the user wants to give relative weights to prioritize work. 

# Special premium features
- The user can load the CVs (PDF) and write a series of cover letters (text-field) saved in JSeek. The cover letter can have parameters (such as company name) that can be filled automatically to facilitate the generic cover letter generation. 

Cover letters can be sliced by: introduction, body, and conclusion. Each one can be swapped by the user and a final cover letter can be generated to fit the job description. 

For example, if the user wants to write an email, they can apply the 'email' variant of the introduction, a 'casual' body variant, and a 'friendly' conclusion variant, depending on the desired tone of the cover letter.
